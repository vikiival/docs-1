# Queries

## Introduction

Squid CLI tooling auto-generates queries as part of the GraphQL schema from the input schema. It generates a range of possible queries and operators that also work with relationships defined in your input schema.

All entities of the input schema tracked by the cli (re-generation is required when any change happens to the input schema) can be queried over the GraphQL endpoint.

## Exploring queries

You can explore the entire schema and the available queries using the GraphiQL interface by running the `graphql-server` that comes with a Squid, or looking at the `graphql-server/generated/schema.graphql` file.

Let’s take a look at the different queries you can run using the GraphQL server. We’ll use examples based on a typical channel/video schema for reference.

* Simple entity queries
* Relation entity queries
* Filter query results / search queries
* Sort query results

### Simple entity queries

You can fetch a single entity or multiple entities of the same type using a simple entity query.

#### **Fetch list of entities**

Example: Fetch a list of channels:

```graphql
query {
  channels {
    id
    handle
  }
}
```

#### **Fetch an entity using its unique fields**

Example: Fetch a channel using by unique id:

{% code title="" %}
```graphql
query Query1 {
  channelByUniqueInput(where: { id: "1" }) {
    id
    handle
  }
}

query Query2 {
  channelByUniqueInput(where: { handle: "Joy Channel" }) {
    id
    handle
  
```
{% endcode %}

### Relation entity queries

Please look at the cross-filters documentation.

### Filter query results / search queries

#### **The `where` argument**

You can use the `where` argument in your queries to filter results based on some field’s values. You can even use multiple filters in the same where clause using the `AND` or the `OR` operators.

For example, to fetch data for a channel named `Joy Channel`:

```graphql
query {
  channels(where: { handle_eq: "Joy Channel" }) {
    id
    handle
  }
}
```

#### **Supported Scalar Types**

Squid supports following scalar types:

* String
* Int
* Float
* BigInt
* Boolean
* Bytes
* DateTime

#### **Equality Operators (`_eq`)**

`_eq` is supported by all the scalar types

The following are examples of using this operator on different types:

1. Fetch a list of videos where `title` is "Bitcoin"
2. Fetch a list of videos where `isExplicit` is "true"
3. Fetch a list of videos `publishedOn` "2021-01-05"

```graphql
query Query1 {
  videos(where: { title_eq: "Bitcoin" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

query Query2 {
  videos(where: { isExplicit_eq: true }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

query Query3 {
  videos(where: { publishedOn_eq: "2021-01-05" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

#### **Greater than or less than operators (`gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte`)**

The `_gt` (greater than), `_lt` (less than), `_gte` (greater than or equal to), `_lte` (less than or equal to) operators are available on `Int, BigInt, Float, DataTime` types.

The following are examples of using these operators on different types:

1. Fetch a list of videos published before "2021-01-05"
2. Fetch a list of channels before block "999"

```graphql
query Query1 {
  videos(where: { publishedOn_gte: "2021-01-05" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

query Query2 {
  channels(where: { block_lte: "999" }) {
    id
    handle
  }
}
```

#### **Text search or pattern matching operators (`_contains`, `_startsWith`, `_endsWith`)**

The `_contains`, `_startsWith`, `_endsWith` operators are used for pattern matching on string fields.

Example:

```graphql
query Query1 {
  videos(where: { title_contains: "Bitcoin" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

query Query2 {
  videos(where: { title_endsWith: "cryptocurrency" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```
