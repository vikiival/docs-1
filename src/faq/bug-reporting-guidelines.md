# Bug reporting guidelines

## Overview

We at Subsquid welcome the help of our community in improving our product. One way to contribute is by creating bug reports.

In order for our team to get the most benefits from issues reported by our community, it is important, when creating a bug report, to include as much information as possible about the issue.

### Where do I report the issue?

The best way to let us know about your issue and prompt us to resolve it is by creating an Issue on GitHub.

[Subsquid's organisation](https://github.com/subsquid) on GitHub contains many repositories, but the [main repository](https://github.com/subsquid/squid) is the one a bug will most likely be related to and it is where an Issue should be created, when in doubt.

### Bug reporting guideline
