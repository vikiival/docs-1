# How to run a processor against a different chain?

You will need to have WebSocket endpoint to connect to the chain node and a Squid Archive. For a registry of Squid Archives, check this community-owned [Archive Registry](https://github.com/subsquid/archive-registry)

If you don't find a suitable Squid Archive in the registry, set up your own Squid archive. There are multiple examples in this [repository](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-archive-setup).

Once set up, we encourage to contribute to the Squid community and make a PR to the [Archive Registry](https://github.com/subsquid/archive-registry).
